## 📘 Overview

Kubeflow enables you to build **portable, scalable, and reproducible ML workflows** on Kubernetes.  
This repository demonstrates how to:

✅ Write Kubeflow Pipelines in **Python DSL**  
✅ Compile pipelines into YAML  
✅ Run them on a Kubernetes + Kubeflow Pipelines backend  
✅ Build real ML workflows that train models

Whether you're a learner or an MLOps engineer, this repo helps you understand and build real Kubeflow projects.
